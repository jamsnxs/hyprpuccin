# About

> **Catppuccin Cartel ‚òïüê±**, a.k.a. the Frappe Mafia 

This rice is designed to be simple yet stylish, featuring a custom script that switches the color scheme between Catppuccin Frappe and Latte for programs that don't support it natively.
The script currently handles:

- Alacritty
- Tmux
- Btop
- Zathura

For Neovim and VS Code, the transition happens automatically on the fly ‚Äî you just need to set Catppuccin Latte as the Light theme and Frappe as the Dark theme.

In Hyprland, the script also toggles the window border colors to match the Light and Dark variants.

In Waybar, it updates the colors of the text, icons, and workspace indicators accordingly.
